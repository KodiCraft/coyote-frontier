# Hi Jess! This is an example of how to make a tail marking.
# In this file we will show how to make two different kinds of tail markings:
# 1. A simple tail marking that uses the old system (please dont use this)
# 2. A more complex tail marking that uses the new system (recommended)
# This process involves three files:
# 1. The .yml file (this file) which defines the marking and its properties
# 2. The .rsi file which contains the sprites for the marking
# 3. The .ftl file which contains the text to show in the customization menu
# You will need to make all three files for your marking to work properly.
# This file will focus on the .yml file, but I will briefly explain the other two files as well.
