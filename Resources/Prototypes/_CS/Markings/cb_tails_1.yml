# WELCOME TO CB TAILS
# Most of these were in a frunked up format on ss13
# this is because Poojawa is a frucking as hole who was too clever for our own good
# and made all these sprites use an RGB-scaled color matrix thing that made it impossible to
# make more for, or port to other, saner codebases.
# until i smashed them with a rock and now we have these
